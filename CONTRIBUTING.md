# Contributing

Thanks for your initiative to help improve this crate. We recommend you develop on Linux and use Visual Studio Code with the recommended extensions.

## Quality control

Since this crate doesn't have a pipeline yet we need to manually verify the quality of this crate.
So before you create a pull request make sure
* clippy is happy: `cargo check` and `cargo clippy`.
* all tests pass: `cargo test --all-features` and `cargo test-all-features`.
  * The latter command requires you to have done `cargo install cargo-all-features`. It will test all relevant combinations of features as specified in the `package.metadata.cargo-all-features` section of `Cargo.toml`.
* the code coverage has not deteriorated: `./test_coverage.sh`.
  * Code coverage is currently only supported on Linux and requires the `llvm-tools` which you can install through `rustup component add llvm-tools-preview`.
* there are no spelling errors.
  * You can use the recommended 'Code Spell Checker' VSCode-plugin for that.
* the code is formatted: `cargo fmt`.
  * You can also use 'format on save' in VSCode.

## Visual Studio Code

For most of the aforementioned actions test- and build-tasks have been defined in `tasks.json`.
The recommended VSCode extensions are related to Rust, spell checking and code coverage gutters. Make sure to install them if you use VSCode.

The code coverage gutters plugin has been pre-configured to look for code coverage information in `coverage/tests.lcov` which is also where the `test_coverage.sh` script writes the coverage information. You may need to press the "âµ” Watch" button in the status bar to show the gutters after you run the script. There's also an HTML report available at `coverage/html/index.html`.

By default all the features of this crate should be disabled, but this may be inconvenient while developing. Just uncomment the default features line in `Cargo.toml` to enable everything.

## Readers and Writers

This crate is far from complete since there are many readers and writers out there whose usage could benefit from chaining. Feel free to help extend this crate with new features that enable new readers and writers.

## Sources and Sinks

Currently, this crate has several different sources, `FileBuilder`, `ProcessBuilder`, `TcpStreamBuilder` and `VecBuilder`, but only one sink, `BincodeBuilder`. It would be nice if more sources and sinks are added to increase the flexibility when using this crate.

## Buffering

Although this crate supports buffering through `BufReader` and `BufWriter` it doesn't take advantage of the fact that they implement the `BufRead` and `BufWrite` traits respectively. Perhaps this crate can be extended in a way that allows one to take advantage of this extra functionality if the other transformations being chained can also take advantage of it.

## no_std

It would be nice to add a `no_std` feature to enable the use of this crate in embedded programming. See also, [A no_std Rust Environment](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/no-std.html).

## Maintenance and Release process

* Regularly update the crate's dependencies: `cargo update`.
* Make sure the version number is increased, if necessary, in accordance with [semver](https://semver.org/).
* Build and verify the documentation: `cargo doc` -> `target/doc/rw-builder/index.html`.
